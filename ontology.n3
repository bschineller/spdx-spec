"""Companies and organizations (collectively “Organizations”) are
widely using and reusing open source and other software
packages. Compliance with the associated licenses requires a set of
analysis activities and due diligence that each Organization performs
independently including: a manual and/or automated scan of software
and identification of associated licenses followed by manual
verification. Software development teams across the globe use the same
open source packages, but little infrastructure exists to facilitate
collaboration on the analysis or share the results of these analysis
activities. As a result, many groups are performing the same work
leading to duplicated efforts and redundant information being
created. The SPDX working group seeks to create a data exchange format
so that information about software packages and related content, may
be collected and shared in a common format with the goal of saving
time and improving data accuracy.  """ .

Purpose: Provide a reference number that can be used to understand
how to parse and interpret the rest of the file. It will enable both
future changes to the specification and to support backward
compatibility. The version number consists of a Major and Minor
version indicator. The Major field will be incramented when one or
more sections are created, modified or deleted. The Minor field will
be incremented when either only the fields within a section are
modified or standard recognized licenses are added to appendix.

Intent: Here, parties exchanging Identification Information in
accordance with SPDX specification need to provide 100% transparency
as to which SPDX specification such Identification Information is
conforming to.

Data Format: SPDX-M.N where: M is Major version number, N is minor version number.

Purpose: Identify how the meta data information in the SPDX file
was generated. If it was generated manually, it should indicate – who
did the analysis. If the information in the file was generated with a
software tool, the file should indicate an identifier and version for

Intent: Here, the generation method will assist the reader of the
Identification Information in self determining the general
reliability/accuracy of the Identification Information.

Data Format: ”Person: person name” (with optional email) or "Company:
company" (depending on which is accountable) or "Tool: tool identifier

should be indicated with separate instances.

particular reviewer to add their name to the file, however it may be
important for participants in the software supply chain to validate

considered as an equivalent to “signed off” or “reviewed
by”. Additional reviewers can be added after the original version of
the SPDX file is created and can occur as an append to the original
